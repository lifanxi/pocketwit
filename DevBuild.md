# Version 0.87 DevBuild - Updated August 17th #

**This is not a Beta. This is pre-Beta. We are running it on our phones, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. Please bear with us while we get it all working correctly.**

Changes in this version

  * Less communication errors.
  * Re-authentication for existing users.
  * At least one End-Point error fixed.

# Introduction #

This is a link to the latest unstable development testing build. We use it to test out code before we feel it's ready for release to general users.  It usually runs ok, but is much more likely to have bugs or crash than a "release" version.

Installing it might overwrite and/or affect an installed "release" build.  It creates its own separate folder and shortcut.

There is no upgrade checker built into the dev build.  However you can always get the latest build by going to the "About" page and choosing "Upgrade".

Fixes some communication errors and allows re-authentication for existing accounts.

More will be solved when we get the correct access-level tokens from Twitter. I am waiting on their reply. Already changed it in the application settings a while ago but still getting Read/Write tokens where we require Read/Write/DM tokens.
